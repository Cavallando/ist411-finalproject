  **Technologies** 
    This project will consist of a Django server hosting a grid of pixels. A "user" will be defined as someone with a given IP address and IP addresses will be recorded to track user actions.

The project will need to be a multi-threaded, load balanced server to maintain the traffice of all of the users simultaneously.
  **Use Cases**

    -A user could earn more daily pixels based on their daily active use.
    -A user will be able to gift pixels to other users.
    -A user will be able to buy pixels
