## Welcome to IST 411 Project


### Project Description 
This project would be a shared canvas for individuals to create whatever they wish, where each user is alotted a certain number of pixels per day and the pixels become overwritable after a certain time.

### Project Design 
  -**Technologies** 
    This project will consist of a Flask server hosting a grid of pixels. A "user" will be defined as someone with a given IP address and IP addresses will be recorded to track user actions. This project would be a WebApp built using ReactJS and hosted on a Django webserver. The project will need to be a multi-threaded, load balanced server to maintain the traffice of all of the users simultaneously.
    
  -**Use Cases**
    -A user will be able to create on a blank canvas
    -A user will be able to collaborate with other users across the world on a single canvas and be able to manage their pixels with each other.
    -A user could earn more daily pixels based on their daily active use.
    -A user will be able to gift pixels to other users.
    -A user will be able to buy pixels
    
### Project Schedule 
  - **Checkpoint 1 (3/20):** The first checkpoint will contain the initial structure of the Flask webserver as well as the homepage for the site with instructions for the user built in ReactJS
  - **Checkpoint 2 (3/27):** The second checkpoint will require the main use case of the site consisting of the blank canvas to be displayed on the site.
  - **Checkpoint 3 (4/04):** The third checkpoint will be set aside to implement the user functionality of actually drawing on the canvas and saving the results given the user's unique address.
  - **Checkpoint 4 (4/11):** The fourth checkpoint will require the time conatrainsts to be placed given the individual user and saving the user's status accordingly
  - **Checkpoint 5 (4/18):** The fifth checkpoint will implement the sharing feature of the application to share/buy more pixels for a given user
  - **Checkpoint 6 (4/25):** The sixth checkpoint will primarily be used to test and gain and active beta user base.
  - **Checkpoint 7 (5/01):** Finalization and testing
  

### Project Justification 
  - This project is compelling because of its crowdsourcing/colloborative nature in whch user's can work together or against each other. This project has not been widely implemented for a long perioud of time. This project is complex in a.Novelty - why is your project different than existing applications, and why should people use it?b.Complexity - why is this project a good showcase of your abilities?
